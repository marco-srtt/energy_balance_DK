In order to run "hydrogen-cost_streamlit.py":

- Open Anaconda
- Create a virtual environment/identify the one you have made for the purpose.
- Click the "play"-button and choose "Open terminal"
- Change directory to the one where your code is located. In my case, I had to write "cd My Tresors\01 - Hybrid Greentech ApS\07 - Research projects\06PF - NEXP2X\04_Assignments\Code\hydrogen-cost".
- Then write "streamlit run hydrogen-cost_streamlit_numpy_v2.py".

It will now open a browser window where you can see the app. 
Whenever you save your python code after making alterations, it will run the code and update the webpage.
